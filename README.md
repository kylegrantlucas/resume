# Resume

The JSON and build scripts that generate my resume.

## Requirements

The requirements list is quite simple:

* Make
* Docker
* [resume-exporter](https://github.com/kylegrantlucas/resume-exporter)

## Usage

You can build the resume with an easy:

  `$ make`

## Why?

1. It's much easier to use git (and GitHub!) to track my resume, before I kept all copies in iCloud and it was a mess.
2. I like nerdy things and this is definitely nerdy.
3. It separates the content from the presentation, meaning I can generate the same resume in multiple styles for multiple purposes.
